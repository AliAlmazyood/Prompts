- Type: [Investment/Acquisition/Partnership/Launch]
- Commitment: [Time/Money/Resources required]
- Expected outcome: [What success looks like]
- Key assumptions: [List 3-5 main assumptions]
- Timeline: [Implementation period]

INVERSION PROTOCOL:

STEP 1 - Failure Scenarios:
List 10 specific ways this decision destroys value.
Rank by probability and impact.

STEP 2 - Fatal Flaw Analysis:
What single factor, if wrong, makes everything collapse?
Why would intelligent people miss this?
What would make this assumption 10x worse than modeled?

STEP 3 - Incentive Misalignment:
Who benefits if you fail?
Who's motivated to see this not work?
What hidden agendas exist?

STEP 4 - Future Regret Test:
Complete these sentences:
"In 3 years, I'll say 'I should have known when...'"
"The obvious warning sign I ignored was..."
"Everyone could see except me that..."

STEP 5 - Kill Questions:
Generate 10 questions that would make you walk away.
Rank by ability to destroy the investment thesis.

OUTPUT:
FATAL FLAW: [Most likely failure point]
PROBABILITY OF FAILURE: [X%]
MUST INVESTIGATE: [Top 5 items]
WALK AWAY IF: [Specific triggers]
